# Rental Listing Interest Analyzer

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze rental listings and predict the level of interest (low, medium, or high) in properties based on various factors such as price, location, description, and other features. Using machine learning algorithms, we classify the interest level to help property owners or renters make more informed decisions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is from [Kaggleâ€™s Two Sigma Connect: Rental Listing Inquiries](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/two-sigma-connect-rental-listing-inquiries). The key features in the dataset include:
- **Listing ID**: Unique identifier for each listing.
- **Created**: Date the listing was added.
- **Price**: Rental price of the property.
- **Bedrooms/Bathrooms**: Number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
- **Description**: Text description of the property.
- **Latitude/Longitude**: Geographic location of the listing.
- **Interest Level**: Target variable indicating the interest level (low, medium, or high).

## Libraries and Tools
The project was developed using the following libraries:
- **Python** (Version X.X)
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Natural Language Processing**: For processing text data from the descriptions

## Project Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and handling missing data, feature engineering.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the data distribution and relationships between features.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Processing text descriptions, handling location data.
4. **Modeling**: Building classification models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy and F1-score.
6. **Model Tuning**: Optimizing model parameters using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

## Results
- **Accuracy**: XX%
- **F1-score**: YY%
- Best-performing model: Random Forest
- Key factors influencing interest levels: Price, location, and description length.
